      <p>
        Since a very young age, I have always been
        interested in all things technology. Even more importantly, how
        technology influences our world. I first began on this tech focused
        journey in middle school. I had taken a class there called "Exploring
        Technology". This class consisted of basic html/css, arduino, and lego
        robotics. This sparked an ever-growing curiosity about tech that
        hasn't left me since. I have continued to pursue and build on my
        interests in higher education. I hope to enter the field of tech and
        work on a project that will influence the physical world around us.

            C++ is the OOP language that I am the most familar with as my former community college and current university use it in order to teach their students about programming.

              I am versed in the fundamentals of web design and how HTML and CSS work together to make an aesthetically pleasing UI. 
              I am also diving into React and Typescript in order to learn how websites are made in the workforce.
